# GaussianTools
Some in-house tools for Gaussian calculations 


# Usage: 
for irc_extract.py:
To run this code, save it to a file (e.g., irc_extract.py) and execute it from the command line, passing the file name as an argument. For example:
python irc_extract.py example_irc.log

for energy_extract.py: 
To run this code, save it to a file (e.g., energy_tract.py) and execute it from the command line. It will print energy, free energy, nbasis and functional for all the Gaussian output files (*.log) in the same directory.
